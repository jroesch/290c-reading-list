  \begin{paper}{Lloyd}
    Contains a whole lot of background on logic programming, with formal mathematical definitions.
    Extremely detailed, though its very dry and dense so it is not particularly easy to read.
    Also, I cannot find a PDF version of this.

  \begin{paper}{Nilsson}
    The first 100 pages or so seem very relevant to the theoretical foundations of Prolog, and it seems to overlap somewhat with~\cite{Lloyd} here.
